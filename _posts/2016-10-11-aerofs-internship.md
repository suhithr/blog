title: Interning at AeroFS
---

In the summer of 2016 I was a Software Engineering Intern at [AeroFS](https://www.aerofs.com).

In the time I was interning at AeroFS the team was working on an awesome new product called [Amium](https://www.amium.com). Amium is a team collaboration application that handles file-sync, team chat, versions, and collaborations around files. I spent my internship using and working on Amium.

On my first day, I had a meeting where I got to choose what I would start working on for the next couple of weeks or so. I was given a bunch of swag, an awesome height-adjustable desk, and a shiny macbook pro + monitor for the summer! I was unfamiliar with the framework used and the codebase. But the engineers were more than helpful in answering my numerous questions and getting me ramped up (shoutout to Rahul for answering all my questions over the first couple of weeks, and being awesome in general). I was able to ship meaningful code in the first couple of days, and as my productivity increased I was given bigger, more important tasks. I had the opportunity to work on all aspects of the stack including infrastructure, mobile, frontend, and backend. It was a great experience as I got to work with a lot of different engineers rather than just work with a single mentor for the whole summer. I was given a lot of responsibility throughout the internship, I liked that.

The office is beautiful, airy, and has an amazing amount of natural light. This coupled with the location (it's right in downtown Palo Alto) made for some fun afternoon ice-cream/boba trips with the team (I miss TinPot and Scoop :( ). The team ate lunch outside together everyday, and this served as a nice break to the day along with a chance to chat with the whole team.
